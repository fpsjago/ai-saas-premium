## The Challenge

DevHub is a developer collaboration platform used by over 50,000 teams. With 80 engineers across four time zones, they struggled with inconsistent code quality, slow code reviews, and repetitive boilerplate work that drained creativity.

"Our senior engineers were spending 40% of their time on code reviews and writing boilerplate. That's not what we hired them for," explains Jake Torres, Head of Engineering.

## The Solution

NexusAI transformed DevHub's development workflow with intelligent automation:

- **AI Code Review**: Automated first-pass reviews caught 90% of common issues before human reviewers ever looked at the code.
- **Smart Boilerplate Generation**: Context-aware code generation produced type-safe boilerplate that matched DevHub's coding standards.
- **Intelligent Test Generation**: NexusAI analyzed code changes and automatically generated relevant unit and integration tests.
- **Documentation Sync**: API documentation stayed in sync with code changes through automated generation.

## The Implementation

DevHub adopted NexusAI incrementally across their engineering organization:

**Month 1**: Pilot with two teams (Frontend Platform and API). Focused on AI code review and boilerplate generation.

**Month 2**: Expanded to all eight engineering teams. Added intelligent test generation and documentation sync.

**Month 3**: Full integration with existing tools (GitHub, Jira, Slack). Custom AI models trained on DevHub's codebase and coding standards.

## Results

Six months after full adoption:

- Average feature development time decreased by 60%
- Code quality scores (measured by SonarQube) improved by 35%
- Sprint velocity increased 2.4x across all teams
- Developer satisfaction scores rose from 6.2 to 8.9 out of 10
- Code review turnaround time dropped from 24 hours to 2 hours

> "NexusAI gave our engineers superpowers. The AI handles the repetitive work, and our team gets to focus on the problems that actually excite them. Morale has never been higher."
