# NexusAI — Premium AI SaaS Template

## Product Spec

**Name:** NexusAI  
**Tagline:** "Ship AI products that look as smart as they are"  
**Price:** $149  
**Stack:** Astro 5 + React + TypeScript + CSS Modules  
**Quality Target:** 9-10/10 (ThemeForest Elite-tier)

---

## Vision

NexusAI is a dark-first, animation-rich Astro template for AI SaaS companies, dev tools, and automation platforms. It combines the best premium patterns: bento grids, parallax scrolling, 3D card interactions, particle effects, and scroll-triggered choreography — all hand-coded with zero dependency on animation libraries.

It should feel like a $5M-funded startup's website on day one.

## Target Audience

1. **AI/ML startups** launching their first product site
2. **Developer tool companies** (CLI tools, APIs, SDKs)
3. **Automation platforms** (workflow builders, integration hubs)
4. **Indie hackers** shipping AI-powered products
5. **Agencies** building sites for AI clients

## Competitive Analysis

### What we beat:
- **Astro Starter Kit**: Functional but zero visual personality
- **Generic SaaS templates**: Cookie-cutter hero + features + pricing
- **AI templates on ThemeForest**: Usually just purple gradients with generic robot imagery

### What we match:
- **Linear.app**: Clean dark aesthetic, attention to micro-interactions
- **Vercel.com**: Grid backgrounds, terminal UI, developer feel
- **Stripe.com**: Animation choreography, section transitions

### What makes us unique:
- Combined bento grid + parallax + 3D cards (nobody does all three)
- Terminal UI as a visual motif (not just decoration)
- Particle system that responds to scroll position
- Violet + Cyan palette (distinctive, not another purple/blue)

## Key Differentiators

1. **Animation Choreography** — Every section has entrance animations with staggered timing. Not just fade-in; sections have personality (cards float, stats count up, code blocks type).

2. **Depth Layers** — Background (grid + particles), midground (gradient orbs), foreground (content). Parallax creates real depth.

3. **Interactive Everything** — Cards tilt on hover (3D), buttons have magnetic pull, navigation items have underline animations, even the cursor has a custom trail on desktop.

4. **Visual Storytelling** — Terminal UIs, code blocks, API response mockups, workflow diagrams — all as styled visual components, not screenshots.

5. **Production-Ready** — Not just pretty. Lighthouse 95+, semantic HTML, full a11y, proper meta tags, sitemap, RSS.

## Technical Requirements

- **Astro 5** with hybrid rendering
- **React** for interactive islands (dark mode toggle, mobile nav, scroll observer, 3D cards)
- **CSS Modules** for scoped styles (no Tailwind — hand-crafted for uniqueness)
- **Zero animation libraries** — all CSS @keyframes + IntersectionObserver + requestAnimationFrame
- **TypeScript** throughout
- **View Transitions API** for page navigation
- Lighthouse: Performance 95+, Accessibility 100, Best Practices 100, SEO 100
- Full responsive: 320px → 2560px
- Reduced motion support (`prefers-reduced-motion`)
